## App description:

This is quiz app that lets users race against time while they answer multiple choice questions about their React knowledge.

Each correctly answered question awards the user points. The app allows users to:

- Answer quiz questions choosing answers from a pre-defined set of choices
- Earn points for each correcly answered question
- Race against time to finish answering all the questions in the quiz
- Compare themselves against their previous highest score

## Libraries and features

- Global state management using React's [Context API](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) and [useReducer](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer)
- Built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
- Quiz questions are fetched from a local file but are set up and ready to be fetched from any API.
- No external library dependencies apart from [react and react-dom](https://github.com/facebook/react)

## Forking and cloning

This project is ready to work out of the box after cloning/forking and running `npm install` on a terminal window running in your app directory.

## Context

This is one of the intermediary projects for the ['The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Redux & More'](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) completed February 2024.

I wrote all of the React code for this app, always writing code before watching the taught content of the module.

After the end of the course, I converted the app to TypeScript as a practice and made the app styles responsive and mobile first.

The styles for this project as well as proposed HTML markup were provided by the course instructor [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/).
